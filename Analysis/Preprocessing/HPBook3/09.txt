GRIM DEFEAT




Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin who all looked extremely confused.

The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall. Im afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to Percy who was looking immensely proud and important. Send word with one of the ghosts.

Professor Dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said Oh yes youll be needing . . .

One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.

Sleep well said Professor Dumbledore closing the door behind him.

The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened.

Everyone into their sleeping bags shouted Percy. Come on now no more talking Lights out in ten minutes

Cmon Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.

Do you think Blacks still in the castle Hermione whispered anxiously.

Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said Ron.

Its very lucky he picked tonight you know said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk. The one night we werent in the tower. . . .

I reckon hes lost track of time being on the run said Ron. Didnt realize it was Halloween. Otherwise hed have come bursting in here.

Hermione shuddered.

All around them people were asking one another the same question: How did he get in

Maybe he knows how to Apparate said a Ravenclaw a few feet away. Just appear out of thin air you know.

Disguised himself probably said a Hufflepuff fifth year.

He couldve flown in suggested Dean Thomas.

Honestly am I the only person whos ever bothered to read Hogwarts: A History said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.

Probably said Ron. Why

Because the castles protected by more than walls you know said Hermione. There are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth. You cant just Apparate in here. And Id like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. Theyre guarding every single entrance to the grounds. Theyd have seen him fly in too. And Filch knows all the secret passages theyll have them covered. . . .

The lights are going out now Percy shouted. I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking

The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars. What with that and the whispering that still filled the hall Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.

Once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry Ron and Hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledores footsteps drew nearer.

Any sign of him Professor asked Percy in a whisper.

No. All well here

Everything under control sir.

Good. Theres no point moving them all now. Ive found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. Youll be able to move them back in tomorrow.

And the Fat Lady sir

Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password so he attacked. Shes still very distressed but once shes calmed down Ill have Mr. Filch restore her.

Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps.

Headmaster It was Snape. Harry kept quite still listening hard. The whole of the third floor has been searched. Hes not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.

What about the Astronomy Tower Professor Trelawneys room The Owlery

All searched . . .

Very well Severus. I didnt really expect Black to linger.

Have you any theory as to how he got in Professor asked Snape.

Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear.

Many Severus each of them as unlikely as the next.

Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledores back was to him but he could see Percys face rapt with attention and Snapes profile which looked angry.

You remember the conversation we had Headmaster just before — ah — the start of term said Snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.

I do Severus said Dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice.

It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns when you appointed —

I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it said Dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didnt reply. I must go down to the dementors said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search was complete.

Didnt they want to help sir said Percy.

Oh yes said Dumbledore coldly. But Im afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.

Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.

Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling.

What was all that about Ron mouthed.

The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone whod listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.

The Fat Ladys ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day.

Hes a complete lunatic said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. Cant we get anyone else

None of the other pictures wanted the job said Percy. Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.

Sir Cadogan however was the least of Harrys worries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and Percy Weasley (acting Harry suspected on his mothers orders) was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.

Theres no point hiding it from you any longer Potter she said in a very serious voice. I know this will come as a shock to you but Sirius Black —

I know hes after me said Harry wearily. I heard Rons dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.

Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a moment or two then said I see Well in that case Potter youll understand why I dont think its a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only your team members its very exposed Potter —

Weve got our first match on Saturday said Harry outraged. Ive got to train Professor

Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor teams prospects; it had been she after all whod suggested him as Seeker in the first place. He waited holding his breath.

Hmm . . . Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field just visible through the rain. Well . . . goodness knows Id like to see us win the Cup at last . . . but all the same Potter . . . Id be happier if a teacher were present. Ill ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.

The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then at their final training session before Saturdays match Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.

Were not playing Slytherin he told them looking very angry. Flints just been to see me. Were playing Hufflepuff instead.

Why chorused the rest of the team.

Flints excuse is that their Seekers arms still injured said Wood grinding his teeth furiously. But its obvious why theyre doing it. Dont want to play in this weather. Think itll damage their chances. . . .

There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as Wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder.

Theres nothing wrong with Malfoys arm said Harry furiously. Hes faking it

I know that but we cant prove it said Wood bitterly. And weve been practicing all those moves assuming were playing Slytherin and instead its Hufflepuff and their styles quite different. Theyve got a new Captain and Seeker Cedric Diggory —

Angelina Alicia and Katie suddenly giggled.

What said Wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior.

Hes that tall good-looking one isnt he said Angelina.

Strong and silent said Katie and they started to giggle again.

Hes only silent because hes too thick to string two words together said Fred impatiently. I dont know why youre worried Oliver Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes remember

We were playing in completely different conditions Wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly. Diggorys put a very strong side together Hes an excellent Seeker I was afraid youd take it like this We mustnt relax We must keep our focus Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us We must win

Oliver calm down said Fred looking slightly alarmed. Were taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.

The day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than Malfoy.

Ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows.

Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips. The third time this happened Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him Diggorys got a very fast swerve Harry so you might want to try looping him —

Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside.

Sorry Im late Professor Lupin I —

But it wasnt Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teachers desk; it was Snape.

This lesson began ten minutes ago Potter so I think well make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.

But Harry didnt move.

Wheres Professor Lupin he said.

He says he is feeling too ill to teach today said Snape with a twisted smile. I believe I told you to sit down

But Harry stayed where he was.

Whats wrong with him

Snapes black eyes glittered.

Nothing life-threatening he said looking as though he wished it were. Five more points from Gryffindor and if I have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty.

Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class.

As I was saying before Potter interrupted Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far —

Please sir weve done boggarts Red Caps kappas and grindylows said Hermione quickly and were just about to start —

Be quiet said Snape coldly. I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupins lack of organization.

Hes the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher weve ever had said Dean Thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.

You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss —

Harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they hadnt covered.

— werewolves said Snape.

But sir said Hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself were not supposed to do werewolves yet were due to start hinkypunks —

Miss Granger said Snape in a voice of deadly calm I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394. He glanced around again. All of you Now

With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books.

Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said Snape.

Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air.

Anyone Snape said ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasnt even taught you the basic distinction between —

We told you said Parvati suddenly we havent got as far as werewolves yet were still on —

Silence snarled Snape. Well well well I never thought Id meet a third-year class who wouldnt even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are. . . .

Please sir said Hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf —

That is the second time you have spoken out of turn Miss Granger said Snape coolly. Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.

Hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once and Ron who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week said loudly You asked us a question and she knows the answer Why ask if you dont want to be told

The class knew instantly hed gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly and the room held its breath.

Detention Weasley Snape said silkily his face very close to Rons. And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed.

No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin.

Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten I wouldnt have given it three. . . .

When the bell rang at last Snape held them back.

You will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention.

Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.

Snapes never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers even if he did want the job Harry said to Hermione. Whys he got it in for Lupin Dyou think this is all because of the boggart

I dont know said Hermione pensively. But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon. . . .

Ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage.

Dyou know what that — (he called Snape something that made Hermione say Ron) — is making me do Ive got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic He was breathing deeply his fists clenched. Why couldnt Black have hidden in Snapes office eh He could have finished him off for us

Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was still dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear.

What did you do that for said Harry furiously.

Peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling.

Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field battling through that gale. Finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory.

As Harry opened the door something brushed against his leg. He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.

You know I reckon Ron was right about you Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. There are plenty of mice around this place — go and chase them. Go on he added nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot. Leave Scabbers alone.

The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches werent called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light and speedy but Diggorys weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course.

Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone.

Stand and fight you mangy cur yelled Sir Cadogan.

Oh shut up Harry yawned.

He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time hed started on toast the rest of the team had turned up.

Its going to be a tough one said Wood who wasnt eating anything.

Stop worrying Oliver said Alicia soothingly we dont mind a bit of rain.

But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before he entered the locker room Harry saw Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.

The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Woods usual pre-match pep talk but it didnt come. He tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him.

The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was cheering they couldnt hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harrys glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this

The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to each other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hoochs mouth form the words Mount your brooms. He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant — they were off.

Harry rose fast but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain.

Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldnt hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadnt seen them coming.

He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart. . . .

With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hoochs whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud.

I called for time-out Wood roared at his team. Come on under here —

They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.

Whats the score

Were fifty points up said Wood but unless we get the Snitch soon well be playing into the night.

Ive got no chance with these on Harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses.

At that very moment Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming.

Ive had an idea Harry Give me your glasses quick

He handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement Hermione tapped them with her wand and said Impervius

There she said handing them back to Harry. Theyll repel water

Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.

Brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd. Okay team lets go for it

Hermiones spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold still wetter than hed ever been in his life but he could see. Full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the Snitch avoiding a Bludger ducking beneath Diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction. . . .

There was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly —

He turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and Harry saw something that distracted him completely — the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats.

Harrys numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished.

Harry came Woods anguished yell from the Gryffindor goalposts. Harry behind you

Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them —

With a jolt of panic Harry threw himself flat to the broom-handle and zoomed toward the Snitch.

Come on he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face. Faster

But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on

And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below. . . .

Before hed had time to think Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down.

At least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. . . . Someone was screaming screaming inside his head . . . a woman . . .

Not Harry not Harry please not Harry

Stand aside you silly girl . . . stand aside now. . . .

Not Harry please no take me kill me instead —

Numbing swirling white mist was filling Harrys brain. . . . What was he doing Why was he flying He needed to help her. . . . She was going to die. . . . She was going to be murdered. . . .

He was falling falling through the icy mist.

Not Harry Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . .

A shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and Harry knew no more.

Lucky the ground was so soft.

I thought he was dead for sure.

But he didnt even break his glasses.

Harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever. He didnt have a clue where he was or how hed got there or what hed been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.

That was the scariest thing Ive ever seen in my life.

Scariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures . . . cold . . . screaming . . .

Harrys eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there looking as though theyd just climbed out of a swimming pool.

Harry said Fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud. Howre you feeling

It was as though Harrys memory was on fast forward. The lightning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the dementors . . .

What happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.

You fell off said Fred. Mustve been — what — fifty feet

We thought youd died said Alicia who was shaking.

Hermione made a small squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.

But the match said Harry. What happened Are we doing a replay

No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.

We didnt — lose

Diggory got the Snitch said George. Just after you fell. He didnt realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square . . . even Wood admits it.

Where is Wood said Harry suddenly realizing he wasnt there.

Still in the showers said Fred. We think hes trying to drown himself.

Harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.

Cmon Harry youve never missed the Snitch before.

There had to be one time you didnt get it said George.

Its not over yet said Fred. We lost by a hundred points right So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin . . .

Hufflepuffll have to lose by at least two hundred points said George.

But if they beat Ravenclaw . . .

No way Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff . . .

It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way —

Harry lay there not saying a word. They had lost . . . for the first time ever he had lost a Quidditch match.

After ten minutes or so Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.

Well come and see you later Fred told him. Dont beat yourself up Harry youre still the best Seeker weve ever had.

The team trooped out trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harrys bed.

Dumbledore was really angry Hermione said in a quaking voice. Ive never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away. . . . He was furious theyd come onto the grounds. We heard him —

Then he magicked you onto a stretcher said Ron. And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were . . .

His voice faded but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him . . . about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.

Did someone get my Nimbus

Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.

Er —

What said Harry looking from one to the other.

Well . . . when you fell off it got blown away said Hermione hesitantly.

And

And it hit — it hit — oh Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow.

Harrys insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.

And he said dreading the answer.

Well you know the Whomping Willow said Ron. It — it doesnt like being hit.

Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around said Hermione in a very small voice.

Slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of Harrys faithful finally beaten broomstick.
